Our company is able to provide engraved cylinder designs used for the finishing of the leather. These cylinders are mounted on buffering machines to reproduce effects or drawings on the leather. The cylinders are engraved with cutting edge, high precision machinery and this allows us to guarantee high product quality and new solutions to fully meet the production needs of our customers.

We have an extensive [catalog](cylinders-catalog.html) of designs and we can also provide bespoke designs at the customer request (with the possibility of exclusivity).

We are constantly looking for new proposals in order to keep up with the current market which is constantly evolving.

We operate throughout Italy and the world market with experience and professional know-how, ready to satisfy the purchase requirement and delivery faster than ever thanks to an excellent organization.
